# Clean Data Handoff

> **WARNING: Do not blindly delete the Firestore database or Firebase Authentication users.** Firestore data, Firebase Auth accounts, Cloudinary assets, and Netlify configuration are separate systems. Deleting one does not remove the others.

## Inventory

| Collection/document | Purpose | Clear for handoff? | Preserve/recreate? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `users` | staff profiles/roles | only approved test staff | recreate school Admin/Super Admin | Auth UID must match document |
| `devices` | device account settings | only approved test devices | preserve or recreate scanners | device Auth user is separate |
| `visitors` | visitor records/images references | usually approved test history | no | Cloudinary cleanup is separate |
| `gatePasses` | pass lifecycle | usually approved test history | no | preserve only if policy requires history |
| `visitLogs` | operational history | only approved history | no | follow school retention policy |
| `auditLogs` | admin/system history | only if policy authorizes | bootstrap audit required | do not remove required evidence casually |
| `reconciliationTasks` | unresolved partial operations | only after investigation | no | never hide unresolved work |
| `settings/app` | operational/security settings | no | preserve or recreate | includes working hours/retention |
| `imageUploads` | server upload sessions | expired/test sessions after review | no | server-only metadata |

There is no separate emergency collection: Emergency reads current inside `gatePasses` and its paper “Accounted” checklist is not persisted.

## Controlled procedure

1. Export/backup the data required by school policy and record the deployed commit.
2. Identify developer/test Auth, staff, and device accounts; decide which school device configuration remains.
3. Approve exact collection/date/account scope. Remove visitor/pass/history records only through a controlled manual or purpose-built process; do not run blanket deletion commands.
4. Remove matching Firebase Authentication accounts only when their Firestore profiles/devices are also intentionally retired.
5. Use authorized server-side Cloudinary cleanup for referenced/orphaned images; Firestore deletion alone leaves assets behind.
6. Preserve or recreate `settings/app`, school devices, and an active Super Admin. Follow [Super Admin Bootstrap](SUPER_ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP.md) for a fresh school owner.
7. Create school Admin/device accounts, run the controlled lifecycle smoke test, and confirm developer/test data is gone.

For a full fresh start, recreate settings, a first Super Admin, required Admins, and device Auth accounts/documents. For partial cleanup, keep `settings/app` and approved `devices`, while removing only approved visitor, pass, and history data. CSV exports are operational exports, not a complete disaster-recovery backup; take an approved Firestore/Auth/Cloudinary inventory before cleanup.
