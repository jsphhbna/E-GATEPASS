# Working Hours and Complete Exports

## Working-hours source of truth

`settings/app.workingHours` is the sole configurable campus access schedule:

```text
start: HH:mm
end: HH:mm
timezone: Asia/Manila
```

Only a Super Admin can submit this field through `/api/update-settings`. Admins may read it but the backend rejects attempts to modify it. The server validates 24-hour `HH:mm` values and requires `start < end`.

`create-pass` reads the setting in the same Firestore transaction used to create the visitor and pass, then derives `validFrom` and `validUntil` on the server. Portal and Kiosk clients never submit validity timestamps. Existing installations whose settings document is missing or contains invalid working hours fall back to `08:00`-`17:00` in `Asia/Manila` so legacy pass creation remains available.

## Complete exports

Visitor records, visitor activity, and administrative activity keep their normal views bounded and offer cursor-based loading. Complete filtered CSV exports fetch Firestore in pages of 250 rather than issuing an unlimited query. Exports stop at 10,000 source records; the UI warns the operator to narrow filters if that safety limit is reached.

Visitor-record CSV honors the selected date, status, and visitor-name filters. Activity CSV honors the selected event type; administrative CSV honors actor-role and action filters. Normal audit exports exclude reconciliation records, Cloudinary image identifiers, QR/pass tokens, credentials, request bodies, and audit metadata. Printing Visitor Records is labeled as the currently loaded view and is not represented as a complete-history export.
